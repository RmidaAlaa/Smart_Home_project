## Introduction
This Smart Home Security System built with Raspberry Pi is designed to enhance the security of your room by alerting you and capturing real-time photos whenever someone attempts to open the door without permission. The system is remotely controlled via the Telegram app, allowing you to receive notifications and control the system from anywhere.

## Features
- Motion Detection: The system detects motion near the door using a gas sensor and activates the security features.
- Door Opening Alert: If someone opens the door without permission, the system triggers an alarm using the buzzer and sends an alert to your Telegram app.
- Real-Time Photo Capture: The USB camera captures a photo of the intruder at the moment the door is opened.
- Remote Control: You can interact with the system using the Telegram app to arm, disarm, and receive status updates.

## Telegram App Integration
To use the system with the Telegram app, follow these steps:
1. Create a new Telegram bot using the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram.
2. Obtain your bot token from BotFather.
3. Add your bot to a Telegram group or send a message to it to enable receiving messages.
4. Find your group ID by following the instructions at [get\_ids\_bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
5. Edit the `config.py` file in the repository and add your bot token and group ID.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the repository directory on your Raspberry Pi.
2. Run the main script using: `python main.py`
3. Interact with the system through the Telegram app using the provided commands (e.g., `/arm`, `/disarm`, `/status`).

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues with the setup or functionality, check the connections of your hardware components.
- Ensure that you have installed the required Python packages as specified in the setup instructions.
- Review the logs generated by the system for error messages and potential solutions.
